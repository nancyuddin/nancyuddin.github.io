Introducing my high-quality threat report for a [mock cyber attack,](https://skillsbuild.clicked.com/experiences/incident-response-with-stakeholders-shadow-session-february-15/) effectively evaluating risk level and delivering recommendations and actions to improve the detection, escalation, containment, and resolution of incidents.

### General Steps on Producing an Incident Response
1. Identify risk and outline the details
    - Learn who was impacted and how by reviewing logs and talking to client and those directly impacted by attack
2. Categorize 
    - Evaluate risk level - do you need to escalate to management?
3. What are the security policies? 
4. Control the environment and block the infected area
5. Notify stakeholders if need be
6. Update anti-malware software, logs, access controls, and perform password changes
7. Develop a training program for all employees on best cyber hygiene practices and phishing attack awareness
8. Take legal action if need be

### Threat Report: Rockstar Games Cyber Attack
#### Executive Summary
In response to a cyber attack on Rockstar Games' network, this threat report provides a comprehensive analysis of the incident, evaluates the risk level, and delivers actionable recommendations to improve the detection, escalation, containment, and resolution of such incidents. The report aims to assess the impact, identify the cause, and propose measures to prevent further damage. By isolating the incident and implementing appropriate security measures, Rockstar Games can mitigate risks and safeguard their sensitive information.

#### Incident Assessment
1. Impact: The cyber attack has compromised sensitive data, including employee and customer information, posing a significant risk to privacy and confidentiality.
2. Affected Devices: Initial investigation indicates that multiple devices across the network have been compromised, potentially exposing a wide range of systems and databases.
3. Recommended Actions:
   - Immediately isolate affected devices from the network to contain the breach and prevent further data exfiltration.
   - Activate incident response team and establish clear communication channels for effective coordination.
   - Engage legal counsel to navigate the legal implications and advise on appropriate actions.
   - Initiate forensic analysis to determine the attack vector, identify vulnerabilities, and gather evidence for potential legal proceedings.

#### Root Causes and Indicators
Based on the investigation, the following issues and indicators contributed to the incident:

- Insufficient network segmentation and access controls, enabling lateral movement within the network.
- Inadequate patch management practices, leaving vulnerable systems exposed to known exploits.
- Lack of effective intrusion detection and prevention systems, allowing unauthorized access and activities to go undetected.
- Potential phishing or social engineering techniques used to gain initial entry into the network.

#### Analysis and Remediation
Given the findings, the following high-level overview outlines the recommended analysis and remediation steps:

- Immediate Isolation: Isolate affected devices from the network to halt the attacker's activities and limit further damage.
- Comprehensive Investigation: Engage a specialized digital forensics team to conduct in-depth analysis, identify the attack vector, and assess the extent of the breach.
- Incident Response and Communication: Implement an incident response plan, including clear escalation and communication protocols, to ensure timely and effective coordination among stakeholders.
- Strengthen Security Controls: Enhance network segmentation, access controls, and patch management practices to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- Training and Awareness: Conduct cybersecurity training programs for employees to raise awareness about phishing attacks and social engineering techniques.
- Legal Actions: Collaborate with legal counsel to determine the appropriate legal actions against the attackers and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

By implementing these recommended steps, Rockstar Games can mitigate the immediate risks, improve their incident response capabilities, and enhance the overall security posture of their network infrastructure.

Note: This threat report represents an initial assessment and should be followed by ongoing monitoring, continuous improvement, and adaptation of security measures to address evolving threats in the cyber landscape.
