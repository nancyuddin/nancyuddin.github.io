Hosting a web application on the cloud ensures scalability, high availability, and cost-efficiency. 
In this lab, I will demonstrate the steps I took to host a WordPress website with a LAMP stack with AWS. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive and widely-used cloud computing platform offered by Amazon, providing a range of cloud services such as computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, and more to help businesses scale and innovate. 

LAMP stack is a popular foundation for web applications. 
**Linux** is the operating system (OS) on which the web server runs. 
**Apache** is the web server software that handles HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and serves web content in response.
**MySQL** is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores and manages the structured data used by web applications.
**PHP** (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language used for web development.

###**Launch a virtual computer with AWS**
1. Launch an EC2 instance (virtual computer on the cloud). Enable SSH, HTTPS, and HTTP.

2. Assign an Elastic IP so the IP address is static and the DNS server knows where the website is hosted.
